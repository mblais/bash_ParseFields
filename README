bash_ParseQuoted
====================
bash functions for parsing possibly-quoted text fields from a string

.. warning:: This is development level software.  Please do not use unless you
             are familiar with what that means and are comfortable using that 
             type of software.

Usage
-----
ParseField() parses a single possibly-quoted text field from a string beginning
at a specified offset, and returns the number of characters scanned. The result
field is returned in $BASH_REMATCH.

ParseFields() can parse a number of consecutive, possibly-quoted, delimited
fields from a string into supplied variable names (similar to the bash 'read' 
builtin).

See the source code for more details.


Installation & Configuration
----------------------------
Source the file ParseFields into your bash script.
